# Course Preparation

Although pre-training for our courses isn't *mandatory*, we do recommend that you spend some time preparing. This document gives some advice on what you can do to make your life much easier on the course, and how to improve your knowledge in general.

The training course aims to produce [T-shaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) people, with a wide breadth of skills plus a specialism. The core modules therefore cover a lot of ground, so anything you can do to gain some prior knowledge will help out.

As far as we're concerned, two of the most important traits for success in the tech industry are **[passion](http://sparta.global/deloitte-pssion)** and **[curiosity](http://sparta.global/cio-curiosity)**. We're hoping you're already passionate about technology, but having the curiosity to find out how and why things work may be something you need to develop.

> *Read everything you can, and then find more to read. That's the best advice I can offer!* ‚Äì **Joe Buckwell**, Sparta Graduate

## Finding things to read

This document provides a few starting points, but it's important that you learn to find interesting stuff through your own channels. Two good places to start are [Twitter](http://twitter.com) and [Medium](http://medium.com).

#### Medium 
1. **Set up an account** ‚Äì You'll be using Medium to write and publish articles during your course.
2. **Follow some people** ‚Äì Follow tags, people and publications that align with your interests in technology. You could start with these:
    * [Technology](https://medium.com/tag/technology)
    * [Startup](https://medium.com/tag/startup)
    * [Ruby](https://medium.com/tag/ruby) (or whatever programming language you favour)
    * [DevOps](https://medium.com/tag/devops)
    * [Business](https://medium.com/tag/business)
    * [Innovation](https://medium.com/tag/innovation)
    * [FreeCodeCamp](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/)
    * [Sparta Global](https://medium.com/sparta-global)
    * [BackChannel](https://backchannel.com/)
    * [The Startup](https://medium.com/swlh)
    * [Personal Growth](https://medium.com/keep-learning-keep-growing)
    * [Medium Engineering](https://medium.engineering/)
    * [Several People are Typing](https://slack.engineering/)

3. **Get the apps** ‚Äì Install the Medium app on your phone. The bookmarks feature is useful.
4. **Write** ‚Äì If you fancy it, write an article ‚úçÔ∏è.

#### Twitter

Twitter is a brilliant place to find interesting and relevant articles, but only if you follow the right people. You could start by following Medium authors whose articles you've enjoyed, and build up your list up by looking at the people they follow.

Feel free to share any good articles or videos you find with [@spartaglobal](http://twitter.com/spartaglobal), too!

#### Pocket

Once you start following enough people on Twitter, Medium, YouTube and the like, it's very easy to get overwhelmed with all the interesting content. Pocket allows you to save articles when you see them, to read them later.

1. Sign up for an account at http://getpocket.com.
2. Install the Browser extension.
3. Install the app on your phone.
4. Start saving and reading articles.

#### What to read?

Being a good technologist is about far more than writing good code or testing: It's about understanding business, and being productive in every area of your life and work. While you should obviously read technical articles, don't discount articles on **business**, **personal productivity**, **habits**, **agile**, **process**, **teamwork**, **communication** and **management**. All these things are just as crucial to your career as your technical ability.

> üìñ If you don't enjoy learning new things every day, you're probably not cut out for the tech industry!

## Learning the basics

#### The Command Line

Regardless of the course you're applying for, you're likely to spend a fair amount of time working with the command line. For those hoping to become engineers (whether development, DevOps or SDET), this is doubly important. We'd recommend the following:

1. Complete free elements of the Codecademy *[Learn the Command Line Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)* (3 hours).
2. Spend some time practising some of the basics. Command like `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `touch`, `ls` should be second nature to you. *(You'll need to be running Linux or macOS to do this. If you're on Windows you can install [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) and use the git-bash app that comes with it.)*
3. **Bonus:** If you fancy a challenge, you could also look into [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) ‚Äì you might find [this](http://www.openvim.com/) useful.

#### Markdown

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a simple language which is used extensively in the tech world. The syntax is pretty simple, and we highly recommend that you [learn it](https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/) before joining the course. Here's a [good interactive tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

You'll use markdown extensively during the course, and many of our students use it to write their notes. (**Interesting fact**: This document is written in Markdownüåü.)


## More online training

Aside from learning the command line and markdown, we'd also recommend that you brush up on some other core competencies.

If you haven't completed them already, we suggest that you complete the free elements of:

* Codeacademy's *[Learn Git Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)* (2 hours).
* Codeacademy's *[Learn SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)* (2 hours)
* Codecademy's *[HTML & CSS Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web)* (7 hours)

Once you've done that, feel free to start any of the other Codecademy courses. They'll all help to expand your knowledge in the right direction.

##### Paid Training

If you've got time on your hands and don't mind spending a bit of money, [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/) offers some fantastic courses in Engineering, while [Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/) offers some great DevOps and Sys Admin training.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è**WARNING:** The CodeSchool and Linux Academy courses are pretty tough. It's far better that you get comfortable with everything else than try to push yourself too far ‚Äì you run the risk of forgetting the more important stuff. 

If you do sign up for either of these, we'd suggest:

* _CodeSchool_
    * **Front-end Foundations** and **Formations** - for anyone.
    * **Try SQL** and **The Sequel to SQL** - for anyone.
    * **Try Git**, **Git Real** and **Mastering GitHub** - for anyone.
    * **MongoDB** - for JS engineers.
    * **JavaScript Road Trip parts 1 and 2** - for JS engineers.
    * **Try Ruby** and **Ruby Bits** - for SDET and DevOps engineers.
* _Linux Academy_
    * **Linux Essentials** - for DevOps engineers.
    * **DevOps Essentials** - for DevOps engineers.


## Agile Software Development

[Agile Software Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) features pretty heavily in our training and while we'll teach you about the philosophy and methodologies, it'd be helpful if you arrive with some understanding of what it's all about. There are hundreds of resources out there that can help you understand what agile. Here are just a few of them:

## Books

There are hundreds of good books on coding and testing. While we'll recommend some of these during the course, we'd rather you read something a little less technical as well. Here are three books we'd recommend to anyone entering the tech industry:

* [The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262509/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1467059023&sr=8-1&keywords=the+phoenix+project) by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford
* [The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Startup-Innovation-Successful-Businesses/dp/0670921602/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1467059032&sr=8-1&keywords=lean+startup) by Eric Ries
* [The Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-Habit-Why-What-Change/dp/1847946240/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1467059040&sr=8-1&keywords=Habits) by Charles Duhigg

The Amazon descriptions should make it clear what they're all about.
